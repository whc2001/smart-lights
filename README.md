# smart-lights

This is a non-intrusive light switch automation controller based on the design of [suyashkumar/smart-lights](https://github.com/suyashkumar/smart-lights). The goal is to accommodate a regular lever-type light switch into Home Assistant without replacing the original switch. ESPHome is used.

# TODO

- [ ] Refine and upload ESPHome config YAML

- [ ] Add an endstop switch or similar to provide some sort of feedback
